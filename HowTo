The bin folder contains all the classes. The best thing to do is to import this as 
an eclipse project. Compilation is done automatically by eclipse and we just need to run 
from the bin folder
<> - denotes compulsory arguments
[] - denotes optional arguments
Go to bin folder
Starting nameserver:
./myjava dos.dfs.farsite.Driver server start <cluster root namespace> <intra cluster id> [nameserver listening port] [intra cluster consistency port]
Eg : ./myjava dos.dfs.farsite.Driver server start farsite/root1 000
Intra cluster id is used to give the nameserver a unique id for intra cluster communication. This should be a string of fixed length( since it is used in paxos too )
The optional arguments are server listening port and intra cluster communication port.
We can set these if we don't want to used default ports. This is useful to run multiple servers
from a single machine

./myjava dos.dfs.farsite.Driver server start standby [nameserver listening port] [intra cluster consistency port]
- The nameserver starts in standby mode waiting for some cluster to delegate responsibility to it

Starting filehost
./myjava dos.dfs.farsite.Driver filehost start [fileHostPort] [fileHostListenerPort] [block Storage path]

Starting client
./myjava dos.dfs.farsite.Driver client start interactive
 starts in interactive mode printing command prompt
./myjava dos.dfs.farsite.Driver client start test <testFilePath>
runs a test specified by testFilePath
The testFile path should just list a series of commands as you would give from the command line itself

Commands:
In all the commands to follow the entire dfsFilePath should be used. Relative naming has not been done. But can be done easily

mkdir <dfsFilePath>
ls <dfsResource>
put <localFilePath> <dfsFileName> (dfsFilePath should contain name also. Just specifying directory won't do)
get <dfsFileName> <localFileName>

Local folders to be created:
/tmp/farsite
/tmp/farsite/blocks - blocks are stored by file host here
/tmp/farsite/resources
/tmp/farsite/data
/tmp/paxos
The foll files should exists in /tmp/farsite/resources
In all the files to follow the address should be in the form of an ip:port pair. Port is included because this helps us to test this 
dfs easily on a single machine. 
namespace_map - contains the mapping of clusterRoots to the responsible addresses
file_hosts - list of file hosts (with their listening port addresses (where they listen for file requests) not the file transfer address (which they use to get files actually) )
cluster_mates_farsite_root1 - a file containing the list of all servers taking care of farsite/root1
							  Name the file this way for whatever cluster this node is running and include all the cluster nodes in this file
							  Addresses should contain ip and cluster consistency port 
hosts						-	List of all potential servers that could be asked to 
								become name servers in future. These should all be running in standby mode

Look in bilvam:/tmp/farsite for example files
